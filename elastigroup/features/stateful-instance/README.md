# Stateful Instances

The concept of data integrity and consistency is crucial when managing workloads. This aspect may be trivial when running with on-demand instances, but itâ€™s not so trivial while working with EC2 spot instances, which are conceptually ephemeral and can be revoked at any given moment. Spot takes this into consideration and enables you to leverage Elastigroup while handling data concerns easily and with confidence.

This section describes Elastigroup Stateful Instance features in detail.
